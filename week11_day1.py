# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TO DO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Teresa"
age = 15
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 13

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"{first_name} and {favorite_color}")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1 = 3
num2 = 3
num3 = int(input("what is your 3rd favorite number")) #5
num4 = int(input("what is your 4th favorite number"))#4
print(num1 + num2) # output 6
print(num3 + num4) #output 9 (it would've been 54 if you didn't use int)
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
